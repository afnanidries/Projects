## What I Learned

This project was my introduction to integrating the Twilio API and using WhatsApp for programmable messaging. I gained hands-on experience working with:

- **Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox**: Learning how sandbox environments work and how verified numbers are required to safely test message delivery.
- **API integration**: Sending POST requests and securely managing credentials with environment variables in both local and cloud environments.
- **Render Deployment**: Iâ€™ve deployed multiple projects to Render, but this helped me further master how to serve subdirectory web services from a monorepo using build/start commands.
- **Node.js + Express**: Reinforced my understanding of routing, handling JSON payloads, and building minimal, production-ready web services.
- **.env configuration + GitHub workflow**: Improved confidence in setting up secure deployment pipelines using `.env`, `.gitignore`, and cross-environment support.
- **Full-stack project flow**: From frontend UI, backend logic, third-party API communication, to cloud deployment â€” this was a comprehensive mini-capstone for real-world service deployment.
